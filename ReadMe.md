This project creates an iOS widget using the [Scriptable App](https://scriptable.app).

## Install the Widget

1. [Download Scriptable on the iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?uo=4)
2. Create a new script inside Scriptable.
3. Rename the script by clicking on its name in the top. *(This step is not necessary but it is good practice. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)*
4. Copy the code of [CBSLaundryWidget.js](https://github.com/Niclaslach/CBSLaundryWidget/blob/main/CBSLaundryWidget.js) into the empty script. (You might have to delete the first 4 lines)
5. Add the Scriptable widget to your homescreen (hold on an app until it shakes and click the "+" button on the upper left corner).  
Suggested size is small.
6. Click on the newly created widget and select the newly created script.

The format should be *\<username\>;\<password\>*  
*Example: 123;0000*
